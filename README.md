# diceGameðŸŽ²
There are two dices on the screen, on refreshing the page both the dices rolls and whichever dice has higher value, Player associated to that dice winsðŸš©!!!
This is a game which has made me learn about the concepts of DOM(Data Object Model) , manipulation of texts,attributes,values,getting and setting methods and a lot more DOM applications in javaScript.
It was so much fun making this, I'm looking forward to see much more coolðŸ˜Ž JS concepts in action.!!
